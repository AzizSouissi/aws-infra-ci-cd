# AWS Infrastructure CI/CD Automation

This repository contains all the necessary files and configurations to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of a web application on AWS using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Docker**, and **GitHub Actions**.

## **Overview**

This project automates the deployment of a containerized web application in the following steps:
1. **Provision Infrastructure**: Use **Terraform** to provision an AWS EC2 instance, VPC, subnet, and security groups.
2. **Configure the Instance**: Use **Ansible** to install Docker on the EC2 instance, pull the application image from GitHub Packages, and run the application as a container.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use **GitHub Actions** to build the Docker image, push it to GitHub Packages, and trigger the deployment process.
